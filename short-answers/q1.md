# Question 1
What is Event Driven Architecture?

# Answer
In software engineering, we can catalog entire programs into different architectural paradigms. These paradigms help explain the design pattern behind the structure and organization of a program in relation to how its components interact, how data flows, and what its interfaces are. Common software architecture paradigms include monolithic architectures, microservices architectures, and **event-driven architecture**.

**Event-driven architecture (EDA)** refers to a system that executes code in response to user-driven action or a system-driven process. Such events can include actions like clicking a button, the reloading of a page, or hovering over an element to display a dropdown menu.

In this system, event listeners continuously listen for specific events, and when triggered, an event handler responds accordingly.

**The syntax is as follows:**

```js
//to add a listener
element.addEventListener('eventType', callbackFunc);

//to remove a listener
element.removeEventListener('eventType', sameCallbackFunc);
```

| Element  | Event Type | Callback Function |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| The HTML element the event listener is attached to | A specific type defined under the event prototype chain (e.g., click, keydown, mouseover, etc.) | The event handler function that executes upon the event type |

Since code does not run until an event condition is met, EDA is asynchronous by nature, as tasks do not follow a predetermined sequence. This contrasts with synchronous architectures, where tasks are executed one after the other in a predefined order.
