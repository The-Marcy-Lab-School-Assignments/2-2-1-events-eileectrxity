# Question 3

Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer

Event delegation is helpful because it helps developers adhere to the DRY principle in event management while keeping things simple.

Instead of needing to attach an event listener to each child element, we can just attach one listener to the parent element to delegate action for all. This makes the code more efficient and easier to manage while reducing memory usage and improving performance.

Event delegation is especially useful when dealing with dynamically generated elements. Newly added child elements will benefit by automatically inheriting event handling from the parentâ€™s event listener, eliminating the need for developers to hardcode their own listener.
