# Question 2

What is event delegation?

# Answer

Event delegation is when we attach a single event listener to a parent element, allowing it to handle events for all its child elements. This way, instead of attaching separate event listeners to each child element, we can delegate the handling of their events to one common parent.

This is made possible by the **event propagation** mechanism that determines how events move through the DOM tree. When you interact with an element (e.g., click on it), that event doesn't just stop thereâ€” it propagates through the DOM to its parent element. This propagation happens in three phases:

**1. Capturing phase:** The event travels from the document root down to the target element.

**2. Target Phase:** The event reaches the target element and triggers its event handler.

**3. Bubbling phase:** The event travels back up from the target element to the document root.

By attaching an event listener to a parent, event delegation takes advantage of the bubbling phase to catch events as they bubble up from child elements to the parent. We can then use the `event.target` property to determine which child element triggered the event and handle it accordingly.

### Event delegation in action:

```html
<style>
  #parentContainer {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .child {
    margin: 5px;
  }
</style>

<div id="ancestorContainer" onclick="alert('Ancestor container')">
  <div id="parentContainer" onclick="alert('Parent container')">
    <button class="child" onclick="alert('Button 1')">1</button>
    <button class="child" onclick="alert('Button 2')">2</button>
    <button class="child" onclick="alert('Button 3')">3</button>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  const parentDelegator = (e) => {
    if (e.target.className === "child") {
      console.log(`Child el clicked: ${e.target.textContent}`);
    }
  };

  const parent = document.getElementById("ancestorContainer");
  parent.addEventListener("click", parentDelegator);
</script>
```

In this example, a click event listener is attached to a parent, `#ancestorContainer`. Upon clicking any button, the event bubbles up to the `#ancestorContainer`, which then handles the event.

The `parentDelegator` event handler function uses `event.target` to identify which button (child element) was clicked and logs its text content.

Given this, if one were to click on button 1, they would see the following string alerts pop up in their browser, one directly after the other:

1. Button 1
2. Parent container
3. Ancestor container
